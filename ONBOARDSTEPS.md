## ‚úÖ Summary of Technical Considerations

- All documents should be grouped under:
```

/\[UserEmail]/\[CompanyName]/\[Step]/\[Field]/\[file(s)]

```

- All uploads should:
- Be renamed to lowercase field-safe filenames.
- Allow **multiple uploads** where appropriate (Zod schema should accept arrays).

- Firebase Storage Rules:
- Authenticated users only.
- Users can only access their own folder (`UserEmail`-scoped).
- Admins can access all folders.

- Form Handling:
- Use `React Hook Form` with dynamic file array fields
- Zod schema per step with `z.array(z.instanceof(File))` for multi-upload fields
- Use progress bar to indicate % completion of due diligence

## üõ† Recommended Upload Component Features

- File name normalization
- Per-field upload folders
- Drag-and-drop or browse
- Multiple file previews per field
- Inline error validation
- Toast notifications for success/failure
- Skeleton loader on upload start

---

## üîç Validation Steps

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Verify user is logged in.
   - Check Firebase auth token.

2. **Form Submission**:
   - Validate against Zod schema.
   - Check file size and type. <= 300KB each file
   - Check file type. Only PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG allowed.
   - Ensure required fields are filled.

3. **Firebase Storage**:
   - Generate unique file paths.
   - Upload files to Firebase Storage.
   - Update Firestore with file references.

4. **UI Feedback**:
   - Show progress indicators.
   - Display success/error messages.
   - Refresh UI after successful upload.
